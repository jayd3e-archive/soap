            The ``payload`` is the original value passed into the :class:`soap.SchemaModel`.
            We keep track of the payload so our validators can potentially see other values
            in the schema, to determine if a single :class:`SchemaNode` is correct, as sometimes
            values depend on one another.

            The ``node`` is the current node being deserialized, and is an instance of
            :class:`soap.SchemaNode`.  A node should almost never get passed into this function,
            as we want it to get defaulted to ``self``.  On rare occassions involving Relationships,
            we want to have a node pass through.  So in this case, we will pass a predetermined
            node that we want this :class:`soap.SchemaNode` to pretend to be.

            The ``model`` is the :class:`soap.SchemaModel` currently being processed.  We hold
